# Devise Scaffold

This shows you how to create User model that is both a Devise authentication model and a
fully scaffolded model. 

I like scaffolding. Some say true programmers should avoid it, but I do feel it helps
when seeding the fully new project. Why not use 'rails g scaffold User...' instead of
creating ten other files that such command does for you. And you do want to see the
list of users at some point anyhow - you being the admin. Or create one!

So follow these commits to do it again.
